ZhDK Interaction Design - Physical Computing HS2019 - Minor Project

Created with Arduino IDE.

Runs on an Arduino Uno, and uses an Adafruit MICS-5524 sensor and a Nokia 5110 screen (library for the screen can be found here: http://www.rinkydinkelectronics.com/library.php?id=47 but is also included in the repo).

Calibration of the sensor is done very rudimentally, there's no garuantee for the results.
